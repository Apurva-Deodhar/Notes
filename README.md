🛠️ Technologies Used
MERN Stack:
1) MongoDB
MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents. It is ideal for applications requiring fast, scalable, and schema-less storage.

2) Express.js
Express.js is a lightweight and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for building APIs and web servers.

3) Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It allows running JavaScript on the server-side and is widely used for building fast and scalable backend services.

4) React
React is a powerful front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses component-based architecture and a virtual DOM to efficiently update and render UI elements.

📦 Additional Libraries
Axios – For making HTTP requests from the frontend to the backend.
Hot Toast – For displaying beautiful and responsive toast notifications.
Lucide – An icon library used for adding elegant and consistent icons to the UI.
Tailwind CSS – A utility-first CSS framework used to design and style the frontend efficiently and responsively
